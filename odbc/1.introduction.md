# ODBC

Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is a standardized API for connecting to databases that is cross-platform and cross-DBMS. By installing an general ODBC driver manager and a driver for your specific DBMS, the code that interacts with the ODBC API can be generalized. This makes ODBC a very powerful tool for both development and for production, as the application can be deployed on any system and talk to any DBMS as long as it has the correct drivers installed.

## Why ODBC?

For the open-source software team, ODBC is the preferred method of connecting to Db2 on IBM i.

* Because ODBC is cross-platform, it allows you to develop your applications directly on your development machine, whether it's a Linux, Windows, or directly on on IBM i. Database connectors built specifically for IBM i often cannot be built or run on a non-IBM i system.

* When it is time to deploy your application to IBM i, you can simply move your code from your development machine to your IBM i system. Your database commands will remain unchanged, and as long as you have also set up ODBC on the IBM i system, everything will _just work_.

* ODBC offers a higher level of connection configuration than is available with CLI-based connectors. This makes it easy for you to change the behavior of Db2 either from on or off system to fit your application's needs.

* By moving to ODBC as opposed to an IBM i-only solution, the open-source team can contribute alongside developers working on other systems, making the open-source software available to IBM i users much more robust.

## Setting Up ODBC

The instructions for setting up your ODBC connection to your IBM i will depend on what operating system you are running. Select your operating system below to see setup instructions for getting ODBC on your system and connected to your IBM i.
