# Example

This quick example will show how your configuration files might look on a non-IBM i machine as your are actively developing against Db2 on IBM i, and then how you would go about transferring that same code to run on your IBM i when you are ready to run in production.

For this example, we will be using Node.js and the `odbc` package available on NPM. Node.js is simply used as an example technology, and this same thing could be done with PHP, Python, R, or any other package that has the ability to connect to the ODBC driver manager.

## Setting up your Development Environment

### Driver Manager, Driver, and DSNs

First, you will have to install your driver manager and driver. Steps to do that can be found in the [Windows](./2.windows.md) or [Linux](./2.linux.md) pages of this tutorial. These pages will also tell you how to set up your Drivers and DSNs, which is a different process depending on if you are on Windows or Linux.

A dummy DSN for connecting to your IBM i might look like:
```ini
[MYDSN]
Description            = My dummy IBM i system for this example
Driver                 = IBM i Access ODBC Driver
System                 = MY.IBMI.SYSTEM.COM
UserID                 = MYIBMIUSER
Password               = password1234
```

Note that your Driver name will have to match the name of a driver from your driver list (either in `odbcinst.ini` or in the Windows ODBC GUI).

### Node.js

Next, you will need to have Node.js installed. You can find the downloads at the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or through your system's package manager.

When you have Node.js installed, navigate to a new folder to contain your project and run:

```
npm init -y
```

This will create a file for you called `package.json`, which tracks software you download from npm (among other things).

Next, install the `odbc` package, which allows Node.js to talk to your driver manager.

```
npm install odbc
```

You now have everything you need to connect to your IBM i Db2 database from your development machine!

## Development

Using the `odbc` package, and passing the name of your DSN as your connection string, all of your queries will be run against the IBM i system listed in the DSN.

**`app.js`**
```javascript
const odbc = require('odbc');

odbc.connect('DSN=MYDSN', (error, connection) => {
  if (error) { throw error; }
  // now have an open connection to your IBM i from any Linux or Windows machine
  connection.query('SELECT * FROM QIWS.QCUSTCDT', (error, result) => {
    if (error) { throw error; }
    console.log(result);
  })
});
```
In this way you can develop remotely instead of directly on your IBM i, while still accessing Db2 on your IBM i.

## Transfer to your IBM i

When you are ready to transfer your program to your IBM i, you just need to make sure you have everything set up on that system.

### Driver Manager, Driver, and DSNs

Like on your development machine, you will have to install your driver manager and driver. Steps to do that can be found in the [IBM i Setup](./2.ibmi.md) page of this tutorial. This page will also tell you where to download the correct Db2 driver and how Drivers and DSNs.

When working directly on your IBM i system and wanting to connect locally, your DSN in `~/.odbc.ini` may look like:

```ini
[MYDSN]
Description            = This local system
Driver                 = IBM i Access ODBC Driver
System                 = localhost
UserID                 = MYIBMIUSER
Password               = password1234
```

Note that your Driver name will have to match the name of in your driver list (which is in `/QOpenSys/etc/odbcinst.ini`).

### Node.js

On IBM i, if you have the open-source environment installed, simply run:

```bash
$ yum install nodejs10
```

You will then have Node.js on your system. You simply need to move your code over to your new system, and because we have the same DSN name as we did on our remote development machine, everything will connect the same as it did when you were developing on a different machine!

If you were to give your local machine a different DSN name (something like `[LOCAL]`), you would simply need to change your connection string in your Node.js application:

**`app.js`**
```javascript
const odbc = require('odbc');

odbc.connect('DSN=LOCAL', (error, connection) => {
  if (error) { throw error; }
  // now have an open connection to your IBM i from any Linux or Windows machine
  connection.query('SELECT * FROM QIWS.QCUSTCDT', (error, result) => {
    if (error) { throw error; }
    console.log(result);
  })
});
```
